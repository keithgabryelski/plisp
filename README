http://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum/ is a requirement for plisp

There are at least two bugs you hit:

1) defun's second argument is a list, so the defun of sum is broken (defun sum l ...  should be (defun sum(l)

2) apply is broken in some way, and I bet I was debugging this when I put the interpreter aside, last time because there is little reason for sum to use apply

Here is the working sum function:

        (defun sum (l)
       	     (if (null l)
                  0
                  (plus (car l) (sum (cdr l)))))
